## Graphics Commands

In addition to the classic C64 Basic 2.0 commands, a handful of graphical commands / functions have been added in order to produce rad graphics to impress your friends.

`GRAPHICS width, height` - Initialize the graphics context to a certain size.

`DRAW color, x, y, [x2, y2]` - Draw a pixel or a line. If `x2, y2` is not provided, a single pixel is drawn. Otherwise, a line is drawn.

`BOX color, left, top, width, height` - Draw a filled rectangle at the specified coordinates.

`RGB(r, g, b)` - Convert the specified red, green, blue values into a single color. Values are between 0 and 255.
