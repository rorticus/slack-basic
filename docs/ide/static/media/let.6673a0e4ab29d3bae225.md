# LET

```
LET <Variable> = <Argument>
```

---

The BASIC-Command LET will be used for assign numerical values or chars in the right type of variable. By using the wrong type of variable the BASIC-error ?TYPE MISMATCH ERROR IN line number occur. Assignment of variables can also be done without LET, so this command isn't used very often.
