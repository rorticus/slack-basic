# LIST
```
LIST [[First Line]-[Last Line]]
```
---

The BASIC command LIST displays the BASIC program currently in memory: By default this listing is sent to the screen, but it can also be sent to e.g. a printer. Since program memory and the LISTing of its content is also used to retrieve and display the directory of a disk, LIST is also used to display such directories.

When LIST is using without any line numbers, the entire program is be listing.
