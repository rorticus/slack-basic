# PRINT

PRINT [<expression>] [[;|,]<expression>...]

---

The BASIC command PRINT is used to print data to the current output device, normally the screen. The argument list might consist of string or numerical expressions concatenated by an optional separator. Such expressions could include variables (strings, integers or floating point) and any allowed mathematical term or known BASIC function. Especially when to print graphic and control characters or any string "as is" they must be enclosed with double quotes (" ") as usual for string constants. If the argument list does not conform to BASIC's expression syntax the error message ?SYNTAX ERROR aborts the execution.
