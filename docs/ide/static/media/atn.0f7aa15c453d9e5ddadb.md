ATN(<numeric-expression>)

---

The numerical function **ATN** is a mathematical function that returns the arc tangent of a numeric value (the inverse function of TAN). The resulting value is the angle in radians of the given tangent. To convert radians into degrees use the formula (rad\*180/Ï€) where rad is the angle in radians.

If the term given in the parentheses is non-numerical, the BASIC error TYPE MISMATCH occurs.
