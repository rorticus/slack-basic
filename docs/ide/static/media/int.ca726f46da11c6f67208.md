**INT** is used to round numbers, whereas rounding is different from its common mathematical definition. By positive numbers the fractional part will be cut, while by neagtive numbers the next lower integer value is returned.

By adding 0.5 to the argument the conventional mathematical rounding can be implemented.

When the argument does not evaluate to a number, the BASIC error TYPE MISMATCH occurs.
