# RIGHT$
```
RIGHT$(<string>,<integer number>)
```
---

**RIGHT$** will be used for cutting strings into component parts beginning at the right side until to the left side. The indicated integer number takes the maximal numbers of chars. When we numerical value is 0, the outcome is a empty string (for example A$=""). When we indicated number is greater than the string, nothing will be cut.
