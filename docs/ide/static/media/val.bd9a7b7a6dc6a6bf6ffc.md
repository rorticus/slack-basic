# VAL
```
VAL(<String>)
```
---

The function **VAL** finds a numerical value in a string. Space chars and the first minus- (-) and plus-char (+) are ignored. The first minus char is interpreted as negative prefix. The searching of the numerical value stopped, when the first non-numerical char is reached. The first dot (.) is interpreted as decimal point and the first e or E as exponent. Mathematical terms and arithmetic operation are ignored.
