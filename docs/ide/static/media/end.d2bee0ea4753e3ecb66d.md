# END

```
END
```

---

The BASIC command END ends the processing of the current program which let interpreter switch back to direct mode, printing the prompt READY. and waiting for input.

Any BASIC code following the END statement won't be processed, but the BASIC commands CONT or RUN [<Line Number>] can be used to resume execution.

Usually END is used somewhere in the middle of program, normally it is not needed at the end of a program, because the program will implicitly end after the last line executed.
